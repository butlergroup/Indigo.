# Indigo :copyright: Project Goals & Info

![logo_small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4beb22fb-0ef7-4abd-81e2-0b150ed6e9c8)

Indigo distinguishes itself in that it's written to provide all the features an organization needs to secure and manage their technology stack and its lifecycle without extra chaff. Instead of having to install one piece of software for SIEM/XDR, one for RMM, one for data backup/DR, and potentially yet another for asset management, you can leverage Indigo and receive all these features in a single platform. **This also allows an organization to reduce the number of third parties they expose their data to.** :lock:

Indigo works on any desktop or mobile platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, or iOS), and is built with memory-safe programming languages. In addition to its robust technical capabilities, Indigo features simple, intuitive in-app navigation, elegant dashboards with pleasing color palettes to display data, and comprehensive reporting options to organize and export your data for review.
