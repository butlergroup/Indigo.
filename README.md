No other SIEM or RMM product currently on the market uses fully memory-safe programming languages in their design. This introduces inherent security vulnerailities in software that's supposed to protect users (people) from malicious actors and/or software. We're going to create such a product. 

If you're interested in contriubuting to or sponsoring the project, please reach out to: welcome@indigo.gallery
